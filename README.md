# Summer_2020
This repo holds miscellaneous code that I didn't know where else to put, haha. Needless to say, this repository doesn't hold all of the code I worked on during the summer of 2020; it simply holds bits and pieces that didn't end up making it to repos of their own.

## Fitness
A good friend of mine has challenged me to work out every day! And while it probably won't happen (every day is a pretty big stretch goal), I thought it'd be fun to see of a graph of my progress. I mean, I can't think of a better incentive to work out than being able to add more data points to a pretty graph a la matplotlib.

## Project Euler
Another friend of mine showed me Project Euler a while ago, and it looked like buckets of fun! So, I'm just working through some of those for kicks, while using it as a good opportunity to become proficient in Golang, the language I'll be using at Twilio during my SWE internship.
